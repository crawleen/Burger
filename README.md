# :hamburger: Eat Da Burger!


### Overview
A Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat... and then devour them!
Please check out the launched app on Heroku [here](http://eat-da-burger.herokuapp.com/)!


### Functionality
Using an home-grown ORM, the app has 3 basic CRUD functions...
  1. READ all entries from the MySQL database and display them to the DOM using Handlebars.
  2. UPDATE a selected burger by clicking "Devour It".
  3. CREATE a new burger using the "Make It Up For Me!" form.

Lastly, the app's front-end design uses Bootstrap.
